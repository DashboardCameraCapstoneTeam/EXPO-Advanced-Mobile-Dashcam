# React Native Application

The Advanced Mobile Dashcam is a React Native application meant to run on android devices and work as a stand in for dashcams. The application makes use of Firebase, and a multitude of 3rd party APIs.

## Installation

Use the package manager [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Application

To start the application, use [expo](https://expo.dev/) and an android or ios device/simulator.

```bash
expo start
```

## Mandatory Plugins
The application makes use of the following expo plugins. To ensure the app works properly, use the installation command as soon as you clone the repository. 
```bash
npx expo install expo-camera
npx expo install expo-device
npx expo install expo-file-system
npx expo install expo-location
npx expo install expo-media-library
npx expo install expo-sharing
npx expo install expo-asset
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npx expo install expo-av
npx expo install react-native-maps
```

## Emulator Limitations
Android and IOS emulation will not work with the following packages.
```bash
npx expo install expo-camera
```
With the use of Camera, one can also take photos and record videos that are then saved to the app's cache. Morever, the component is also capable of detecting faces and bar codes appearing in the preview.
